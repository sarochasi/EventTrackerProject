## HTML/Angular Front End

The front end of the Job Application Tracker is built using Angular. It provides a dynamic user interface for tracking job applications, managing job statuses, and viewing job details. The following features are included in the front end:

### Key Features

* Job Listing: Displays a list of all job applications, including position, company, status, and other relevant details.
* Job CRUD Operations:
  * Create new job entries using a form with fields such as Position, Company, Status, and Description.
  * Edit existing jobs to update their details.
  * Delete job entries.
* Status Selection: Users can select the job status from predefined options such as "Not applied yet", "Applied", "Interviewed", "Offered", and "Rejected".
* Onsite/Remote Option: Users can specify whether the job is Onsite, Remote, or Hybrid.

## HTML/JavaScript Front End using XHR/AJAX

The front-end of TrackMyJob is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) requests handled via the XMLHttpRequest object (XHR). This enables seamless interaction between the client and server without reloading the page.

### Key Functionalities

* Create New Job: The user fills out a form with job details such as position, company, date applied, status, and onsite/remote options. When the "Add New Job" button is clicked, the form data is sent as a JSON object to the server via an AJAX POST request.
* Edit Job: When a user clicks the "Edit" button, the job form is populated with the current details of the selected job. Upon updating the job, an AJAX PUT request is made to save the changes.
* Delete Job: Users can delete a job entry by clicking the "Delete" button. This action triggers an AJAX DELETE request, which disables the job entry in the backend.
* View Job Details: The user can retrieve job information without page reloads by clicking on job entries, which sends an AJAX GET request to display the selected job's details dynamically.

## Technologies Used

* Java: Programming language used for the application.
* Spring Boot: Framework for building the application and REST APIs.
* Spring Data JPA: Used for ORM and database operations.
* Hibernate: ORM implementation used by Spring Data JPA.
* MySQL: Database management system to store application data.
* JSON: Data format for sending and receiving data through REST APIs.

## Lesson Learned

* Understanding how to implement RESTful services using Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA significantly improved my knowledge of web application development.
* Gained practical experience in using annotations like @RestController, @RequestMapping, and @PathVariable to handle HTTP requests.
* Learned how to manage relationships between entities, such as User, Job, OnsiteRemote, and Status, using JPA annotations like @ManyToOne and @ManyToMany.
